### Fourier Prediction for Stocks

[Link](https://github.com/jamesdu351/Fourier-Prediction)

Dataset is daily stock data from a few thousand major companies (top thousand universe)
Using a standard fourier transformation to predict a 1 week directional trend.
For stronger fourier signals, invest 1k into stocks and calculate final profits.
Returns over a one month testing period were 7% with more potential optimization to explore


### LSTM prediction for Stocks

Proof of concept of an LSTM model being used for Stocks
Long Short Term Memory is a proven concept in data with time series data, and stocks contain significant time series data.


### Road Casualty Predicitons

A complete data analysis on Road casualties in the UK in 2021.
Dataset is combined with geolocational data and potential indicators and correlations for certain severities of accidents can be seen.


### Twitter Sentiment Analysis

A kaggle dataset on tweets about the Russo-Ukrainian Conflict.
Tweets come in multiple languages which complicates feature extraction.
Overall tweet sentiment within the collected time period are mostly in support with Ukraine.


### SQL Database

An example database designed in SQL that would match potential tutors with respective students. 


## Contributions to Projects

### Crypto Modeling

[Link](https://github.com/jamesdu351/Crypto-Modeling)

A code piece that produces an alpha based on user inputs.
I was responsible for bugfixing the exec commands and testing functionality


### StyleGAN with fMRI imaging

[Link](https://github.com/ucsb-ds-capstone-2022/ucsb-ds-capstone-2022.github.io)

Usage of Generative Adversarial Networks to map images seen during fMRI scans to the brain pattern shown on the scan.
Interesting final results is the ability to 'create' an image based off off of fMRI scans alone.
Since humans brain chemistry is very unique and complex, each image recreation has limited generalizaiton.

### NLP Classification
